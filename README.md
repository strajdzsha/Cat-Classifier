# Cat Classifier
This project was inspired by Deep Learing Specialization courses on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). It contains code in Python written from scratch (that is, using only lybraries such as NumPy, matplotlib... no machine learning lybraries where used). Code can distinguish cats from random images with accuracy of 82%.
